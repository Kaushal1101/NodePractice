These are the step by step instructions for the setup and design of the movies project.

First, create a backend folder and inside it, create a server.js file.

Next, in the movies-project dir, run npm init. Set entry point to server.js (not sure if it really matters,
 can change it later anyways)

Then, add a .gitignore file in the dir, and fill it in with 

Next run npm install express mongoose colours dotenv (for now, this dependencies are enough)

Then run npm install -D nodemon (node monitor continously runs program so changes are reflected without restarting server)

In the package.json file, remove the line " "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1" ".
They are replaced with two lines for start and server terminal commands. These modifications allow us to run 
the long commands using the shortcuts npm run start and npm run server.

Create a .env file in backend to store sensitive data, that can be accessed by other js files

Create a new folder, routes under backend, and a file movieRoutes.js under it. This stores all routes for server

Create a new folder, controller, with movieController.js under it. This defines all the CRUD functions for requests.

Create a new folder, middleware, with errorMiddleware.js under it. This defines an error handler to catch errors.

Next install async handler using npm install express-async-handler to handle errors asynchronously
